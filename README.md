# Some Grid Engine/Son of Grid Engine/Sun Grid Engine

Some Grid Engine is a fork of Son of Grid Engine at University of Liverpool, with SOME improvement.

We have been using and maintaining this software at Michigan Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan for over a decade. It is stable and good enough for a small HPC cluster. Here we share it on github, hoping more peoples can benefit from it.

## Improvements
- Support for submitting jobs via SystemD which also allows to enforce memory/cpu limitations via kernel cgroups. Many thanks to [fretn:master](https://github.com/fretn/sge) and [ondrejv2:master](https://github.com/ondrejv2/sge)!
- CMake compiling support. This paved the way for easier maintenance in future. It took 38 seconds to compile in parallel and install on an 8-core old machine, while it took 302 seconds with the legacy SGE way, and 377 seconds with makepkg.
- Fixed a permission error introduced since systemd 241 in 2019 during installation, if SGE is installed as non-root on production system
- Compatible with openssl-1.1.1
- All C compling warning are fixed on Arch Linux and Void Linux. Most of them were caused by 'smarter' gcc, new SSL, new GLIBC, obsolete function such 'sigignore', depreciated function such as 'readdir\_r', etc.
- Underscore in port service name 'sge\_qmaster/sge\_execd' is changed to hyphen in all C files and shell scripts, saving us from modifying /etc/services each time
- Supports both systemd and runit on Void Linux
- Version is changed to the commit version of this github repo
- [5 keystrokes to setup a demo cluster on any Linux machine without root privilege](tests/5-keystrokes-to-setup-a-cluster-without-root-privilege/)

```
apt install git build-essential libhwloc-dev libssl-dev libtirpc-dev libmotif-dev libxext-dev libncurses-dev libdb5.3-dev libpam0g-dev pkgconf libsystemd-dev cmake
```

xbps-install cmake make gcc openssl-devel motif-devel hwloc libhwloc-devel libtirpc-devel ncurses-devel pam-devel
```

- **CentOS 7.9.2009**, 2022-04-16, with SELinux set to permissive
```
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install git hwloc-devel openssl-devel libtirpc-devel motif-devel ncurses-devel libdb-devel pam-devel systemd-devel wget
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.23.0/cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xvfz cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
export PATH=$(realpath cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64)/bin:$PATH
```

- **Rocky 8.5** and **AlmaLinux 8.5**, 2022-04-16, with SELinux set to permissive
```
dnf group install "Development Tools"
dnf --enablerepo=powertools install git hwloc-devel openssl-devel libtirpc-devel motif-devel ncurses-devel libdb-devel pam-devel cmake systemd-devel pkgconf
```

## Three different installation methods

1) **CMake**, recommended
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/sge -DSYSTEMD=OFF #or ON if it is not Void Linux or CentOS 7
cmake --build build -j
sudo cmake --install build
```
Please check [the tested environment below](#environmet) in case of any compiling issue.

2) **Legacy SGE installation on modern Linux distributions**
```
make
sudo make install
```
Please check the original source/README.BUILD for detail

3) **Legacy SGE installation on Arch Linux**
```
cp PKGBUILD.in PKGBUILD
makepkg
sudo pacman -U sge-r*.pkg.tar.zst
```

## Quick test on one machine
- step 1, as root.

First of all, change option **admin_user** in [bootstrapfile](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/bootstrap.html)
```
useradd -r -d /opt/sge sge
chown -R sge /opt/sge
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_qmaster
yes "" | ./install_execd
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qhost -q #you should be able to see five lines of output
qconf -as $HOSTNAME #add this node as submit host
```

- step 2, as a regular account
```
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
echo hostname | qsub -cwd
watch qstat #check job status
ls STDIN.* #check job output
```

## Installation

All SGE services are running under user **sge** for security reason, as this is production system.

Assuming master node hostname is **master**, and execution nodes hostnames is **node-XX**.
**/etc/hosts** on master and all nodes shoud be like it:
```
10.1.1.1	 master
10.1.1.11	 node-01
10.1.1.12	 node-02
...
10.1.1.1N	 node-0N
```
All IP addresses are as an example.

#### The first - on all nodes as root
```
ping master
ping node-XX
useradd -u <UID> -r -d /opt/sge sge
```
sge UID should be equal on all machines.

#### The second - on master as root

First of all, change option **admin_user** in [bootstrapfile](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/bootstrap.html)
```
chown -R sge /opt/sge
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_qmaster
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qconf -as master
```
Next commands it's necessary to run for each nodes in cluster:
```
qconf -ah node-01
qconf -ah node-02
...
qconf -ah node-0N
```

#### The third - on all nodes as root
```
mkdir -p /opt/sge/default
chown -R sge /opt/sge/default
scp -pr master:/opt/sge/default/common /opt/sge/default/common
cd /opt/sge
yes "" | ./install_execd
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
qhost -q
```

#### The fourth - on master as any non-root user
```
source /opt/sge/default/common/settings.sh
echo hostname | qsub -cwd
watch qstat
cat STDIN.*
```
